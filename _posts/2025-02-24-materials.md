title: "Painters and Sculptors"
---

Consider two types of art: painting and sculpting. 
A painter starts with a blank canvas, a sculptor starts with a block of (for example) marble.
Both use their skills to create something new, an expression of their artistic vision.

I see an analogy here with LLMs. 
On the one hand, someone (*the AI painter*) can start with a blank page, craft a poem, essay, email, etc. 
On the other hand, someone else (*the AI sculptor*) can - with a prompt - have an LLM generate the poem/essay/email and present it to the user. 
The painter will add to the canvas, and perhaps use AI as one of his tools, to rewrite, correct, or refine. 
The sculptor will use his own tools to chip away and refine the block to uncover what he is looking for underneath. 

If you want to use AI to generate the first version of your text, don't consider it to be the "first version." 
Instead, think of it as the marble slab. 
Use it as your raw materials to make what you want. 
And if you are less comfortable with having AI write your content, start with your blank canvas.
If you need it, AI is there to help refine what you are writing.
