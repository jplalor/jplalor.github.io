---


I'm going to Albuquerque next week for [NAACL](https://2025.naacl.org/). 

Ryan Cook will be presenting our paper "No Simple Answer to Data Complexity: An Examination of Instance-Level Complexity Metrics for Classification Tasks" during the main conference.
 
I will present a poster for our work "Bias A-head? Analyzing Bias in Transformer-Based Language Model Attention Heads" at the [TrustNLP workshop](https://trustnlpworkshop.github.io/).
