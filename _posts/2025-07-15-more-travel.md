title: "ACL 2025"

I promise this isn't turning into a travel blog.
But perhaps this will be the kick-start to more regular updates. 

At the end of the month, I'll be traveling to Vienna for [ACL 2025](https://2025.aclweb.org/). 
There we'll have three presentations:

- Textagon as part of the main conference System Demonstrations track
  - with Ruiyang Qin, David Dobolyi, and Ahmed Abbasi 
- Two papers in the GEM2 Workshop: Generation, Evaluation & Metrics 
  - Bridging the LLM Accessibility Divide? Performance, Fairness, and Cost of Closed versus Open LLMs for Automated Essay Scoring with Kezia Oketch, Yi Yang, and Ahmed Abbasi
  - PersonaTwin: A Multi-Tier Prompt Conditioning Framework for Generating and Evaluating Personalized Digital Twins with Sihan Chen, Yi Yang, and Ahmed Abbasi
